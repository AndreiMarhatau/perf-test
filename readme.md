# PC Performance Test Suite

A comprehensive cross-platform performance testing tool that evaluates your device's CPU single-core performance and drive I/O performance.

## Quick Run

Run the performance test directly without downloading:
- In bash:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndreiMarhatau/perf-test/main/main.py | python3 -
```
- Powershell:
```pwsh
(iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndreiMarhatau/perf-test/main/main.py).Content | python -

### iPhone
Use one of the apps that let you run python code, or even bash commands. A-shell works well - just run above bash command there.
